The Data

The data come from five high school geometry courses taught by the same teacher at Capitol High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
The units of measure are individual students, and the variable being measured are specific content objectives listed on the state guidelines for Geometry.
At the end of each lesson, students are given a learning assessment, typically consisting of four mechanical understanding questions in increasing difficulty and a synthesis item.  
The first four questions are meant to gauge the students' understanding of how to apply mathematical procedures while the synthesis item typically requires that the student explain a thought process in his/her own words.
All five items are scored and the number each student got correct is reported in Tracker.xlsx.  
Note that the number of items in each assessment is typically five but is not uniformly so.

Diagnostics.xlsx contains the results of a Spring diagnostics test administered by the district.
Each student received a score of "proficient" or "not proficient" in each of the content objectives, denoted by 1 and 0, respectively.
The number of items per objective varied but were not included in the report.
